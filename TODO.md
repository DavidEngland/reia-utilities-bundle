  - [ ] POT file generation
  - [ ] RTL language support

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED ITEMS

- [x] **WordPress roles implementation** *(using built-in `manage_options` capability)*
- [x] All 8 core utilities implemented and functional
- [x] AJAX-based UI with real-time progress tracking
- [x] Local and staging environment testing
- [x] Documentation and contribution guidelines
- [x] GitHub repository setup with issue templates
- [x] Beta testing program launch
- [x] Open source preparation and honest marketing

## üéØ Beta Testing Priorities

### What We Need to Validate
1. **Does it work reliably across different hosting environments?**
2. **Are the backup functions actually reliable?**
3. **Do the performance improvements translate to real-world gains?**
4. **What breaks in edge cases we haven't considered?**
5. **Is the admin-only security properly implemented?**

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 10+ successful tests across different hosting providers
- [ ] 5+ successful backup/restore cycles
- [ ] Documented performance improvements on real sites
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Positive feedback from 15+ beta testers

## üìù Notes

### WordPress Roles Implementation
WordPress has a robust built-in roles and capabilities system. We're using `manage_options` capability which is typically only available to administrators. This should be sufficient for our needs:

```php
// Already implemented in current code
if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
    wp_die('Access denied');
}
```

### Modularization Approach
When we implement modularization, consider:
- Individual utility classes in `/utilities/` directory
- Base utility interface/abstract class
- Plugin loader that registers available utilities
- Settings for enabling/disabling specific utilities

### Backup Testing Priority
This is the highest risk utility - if backups don't work when users need them, that's a critical failure. Extensive testing needed before production recommendations.
