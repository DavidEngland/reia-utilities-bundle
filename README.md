### Testing Environment Example
```
Local Development Testing:
- Autoload size: Reduced in test scenarios
- Database size: Cleanup operations functional
- Page load time: Improvements observed locally

Note: Real-world validation needed across different environments
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Database Operations
- Uses WordPress native `$wpdb` for all database operations
- Implements proper escaping and sanitization
- Includes rollback mechanisms for critical operations
- Optimizes tables using MySQL `OPTIMIZE TABLE`

### Security Measures
- All AJAX requests use WordPress nonces
- Capability checks on every operation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Protected file deletion with whitelist approach

### Performance Considerations
- Chunked processing for large datasets
- Memory-efficient file operations
- Background processing for time-intensive tasks
- Progress indicators for user feedback

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ZipArchive not available" error**
- Install `php-zip` extension on your server
- Contact your hosting provider for assistance

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Check file permissions on wp-content directory
- Ensure WordPress has write access to backup directory

**Backup creation fails**
- Check available disk space
- Increase PHP memory limit if needed
- Exclude large directories if necessary

**Database operations timeout**
- Increase PHP max_execution_time
- Run utilities in smaller batches
- Contact support for large database optimization

### Debug Mode
Enable WordPress debug mode for detailed error logging:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```
